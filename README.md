- If the payment is for a book, create a duplicate packing slip for the royalty department.
- If the payment is for a membership, activate that membership.
- If the payment is an upgrade to a membership, apply the upgrade.
- If the payment is for a membership or upgrade, e-mail the owner and inform them of the activation/upgrade.
- If the payment is for the video “Learning to Ski,” add a free “First Aid” video to the packing slip (the result of a court decision in 1997).
- If the payment is for a physical product or a book, generate a commission payment to the agent.
and so on, and so on, for seven long, long, yellow pages.
